        <p>I graduated from The University of Maryland, College Park with a BS in Finance in 2006.  
            After that I went to work for a mortgage company as a staff accountant and office manager.  
            When the housing market crashed in the late 2000's I went to work for my family's construction company,
            Daystar Contracting, LLC, as a construction project manager.
            I got my first taste of coding at Daystar Contracting, LLC, where I developed a website for the company.
            I really enjoyed the experience, and pursued coding through an online course at HackReactor, a San Francisco based coding
            school.  I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals at HackReactor.  Again, I really enjoyed my coding experience, and 
            decided to continue developing my coding skills.  In August 2018 I moved to Miami, FL to attend the Full Stack Web Development
            Program at Wyncode Academy.  At Wyncode, I continued building my HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills, as well as 
            learning React.js, and Ruby on Rails.  I had a wonderful experience at Wyncode, and my time there helped me to realize that coding
            is what I want to  do  for the rest of my life.
            After Wyncode I got an internship at Miami Dev Shop, assisting senior developers on production apps.  I got some exposure to Node.js, and Hapi.js while I was there.
            Now I am ready for a full-time position as a full stack web developer!
